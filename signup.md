# How to create an EDR account
EDR is currently in a private beta test phase.
If you would like to participate:
 - fill up [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUikUIbKdcjMsWpzB4kX-iPIFvUIaBO2qHD00NveMDvpAnow/viewform)
 - wait for LeKeno to contact you (in-game or over the official forums) with your credentials
 - follow the instructions in the **How to** section to sign-in with your account.

# How to
## Pre-requisites
 - Platform: Windows (the overlay doesn't work on Mac OS).
 - Have [EDMC installed and configured](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/#installation)
 - Have [EDR installed and working](https://github.com/lekeno/edr/blob/master/README.md)
 - Playing [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) in Open
 - EDR credentials (i.e. user email and password)

## Install
 1. Launch EDMC.
 2. Click on EDMC's File menu then Settings
 3. Click on the EDR tab.
 4. Enter your EDR credentials (i.e. email and password)
 5. Click OK, launch Elite, look at the EDR status line. It should say authenticated and then a bunch of things depending on what happens in the game.
 6. Try one of the command that requires an EDR account, e.g. send ```o7``` to a contact. EDR should not show the "EDR needs you!" message.
