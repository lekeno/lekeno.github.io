<h1>How to create an EDR account</h1>
<p>EDR is currently in a private beta test phase. If you would like to participate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fill up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUikUIbKdcjMsWpzB4kX-iPIFvUIaBO2qHD00NveMDvpAnow/viewform">this form</a></li>
    <li>Wait for LeKeno to contact you (in-game or over the official forums) with your credentials</li>
</ul>
<h1>How to sign-in</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Launch EDMC.</li>
    <li>Click on EDMC's File menu then Settings</li>
    <li>Click on the EDR tab.</li>
    <li>Enter your EDR credentials (i.e. email and password)</li>
    <li>Click OK, launch Elite, look at the EDR status line. It should say authenticated and then a bunch of things depending on what happens in the game.</li>
    <li>Try one of the command that requires an EDR account, e.g. send <em>o7</em> to a contact. EDR should not show the "EDR needs you!" message.</li>
</ol>
<h1>How to use</h1>
The project's <a href="https://github.com/lekeno/edr/blob/master/README.md">README</a> has more details on what EDR can do and how to use it.
